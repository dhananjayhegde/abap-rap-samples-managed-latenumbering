# ABAP RAP Samples - compatiable with abapGit
Earlier [ABAP Sample Repo](https://github.com/dhananjayhegde/ABAP-RAP-Samples) was not compatible with abapGit - i.e. code was manually copied to the repo instead of pushing them via abapGit. So, if someone wanted to reuse them, it would be very difficult to manually navigate through different files and figure out what to take over.

So, I decided to create a new package and use that for all future `Sample` development.  Now, I use abapGit to push the code from my Trial account to this repo.  This will also help me in future when my own Trial account gets deleted and I have to create new one!
